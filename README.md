Created for my grade 12 calculus final project.

This traffic model was implemented in Python using the graphics library Raylib in order to visualize the flow of vehicles through the system. Using crowdsourced data from OpenStreetMap, a service which provides global roadway data, the model is able to simulate any real-world road system in areas spanning up to 20 km2. In the form of a geocode (latitude and longitude pair), the location of any road system can be inputed, and the model will generate a close approximation of the road data in the form of a graph network.
